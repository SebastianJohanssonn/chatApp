# Second assignement in my API course together with my classmate Anel.

### This is a chat app that uses webbsockets (socket.io) and has implementations that interact with a 3rd party system.
### You can send messages to each other, there is also a feature that makes it possible to send gifs using "/" in the beginning of the message.
### How to start the app:
1. Type "npm install" to install the dependencies.
2. Type "npm start" to start the server, if the script does not work, type "node server.js" instead.
3. Type in the browser window of your choice "localhost:3000" to look at the result.
